Project Title: Portfolio

My motivation for this project was to apply what I learned so far through HTML and CSS and apply those skills on my webpage portfolio. This skill is what most jobs look for and securing a job in the future and very essential as a front end developer.

I learned differnt styles off css and was really fun to see what each one did.
